Bot made in python for welcome channels.
I had the help of 2 friends to test it, [yHaper](https://github.com/yHaper) and [hiosaki](https://github.com/Senkyn).

## How to configure ?

Put the information in the file ```config.json```

## How to costumize ?
In the code, I put some comments indicating where the GIF is if you want to change it
If you want to change the colors, I'll leave a table with some examples below:


| `Color`   | `rgb` |
| ----------|--------|
| PaleGreen | (152,251,152) |
| SlateBlue | (105,89,205) |
| Blue | (0,0,255) |
| DarkViolet | (148,0,211) |
| DeepPink | (255,20,147) |
| DarkRed | (139,0,0) |

## Requirements

Paste the commands in your terminal

```
pip install discord.py
```
